## 📝 Description
This is a small app that will manage run records using springboot on Intellij. This is based on a tutorial made by Dan Vega (https://github.com/danvega).

## 🌟 What we've done!
  * The app will obtain some data from a JSON file, that will be loaded on a in-memory database using h2 database dependency.
  * This data is not permanent, bu it's configured to load everytime we start the app.
  * We can access the database from the browser on http://localhost:8080/h2-console.
  * For the test i'm using Postman.

## 🛠 Prerequisites
    *Java Fundamentals (Beginner - Intermediate)
    *JDK 17+
    *Java Build Tools (Maven / Gradle)
    *IDE / Text Editor
        IntelliJ IDEA
    *API Testing Tool
        Postman

## 🐛 Problems
I did had some problem when i try to include a database on the process. I try to use Postgres, but somehow Intellij wasn't able to access it. The configuration is not
included in this repository.
